# Create Game Jam 2019 Spring Edition

This repository contains the source code for the Create Jam game created by me and my fellow teammates during the 2019 spring edition of the event.
The team consisted of 4 members, 2 programmers, a sound guy and a artist. 

For this project I was in charge of planning, helping on the code behind the game and the game designer.
